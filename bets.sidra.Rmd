## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r sidra1}
sidra=ecoseries::series_sidra(x = c(1612), from = 1990, to = 2015, territory = "brazil")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r sidra2}
sidra=ecoseries::series_sidra(x = c(3653), from = c("200201"), 
                   to = c("201512"), territory = "brazil", 
                   variable = 3135, sections = c(129316,129330),
                   cl = 544)
```



## 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r sidra3}
sidra=ecoseries::series_sidra(x = c(1618), from = c("201703"), to = c("201703"), 
                   territory = "brazil", variable = 109, sections=list(c(39427),
                                                                       c(39437,39441)), 
                   cl = c(49, 48))
```
